# Biome Science Project
This is comprised of several different files 



## Model/Map of a Marine Biome
This is a map made in Google Earth to showcase the location of several marine animals, and details regarding if they are producer/consumers or predator/prey
Directions to import this file can be found here:
1. Save this file: [Jacob's Biome Model.kml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mahldcat/jacobscienceproject/main/Jacob's%20Biome%20Model.kml) to disk
2. Next you will need to follow the directions here: https://support.google.com/earth/answer/7365595?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop 

## Food Web
[FoodWeb](https://github.com/mahldcat/jacobscienceproject/blob/main/foodWeb.md)
This uses a markup language called Mermaid to showcase the food web for different marine animals 

## Weather Graphs
https://github.com/mahldcat/jacobscienceproject/blob/main/Jacob%20Biome%20Temp%20Charts.xlsx
This is an excel spreadsheet that contains the data and graphs for the different temperatures of the named oceans across the Earth

## Symbiotic Relationships in the Marine Biome 
1. Predation, (One creature eats the other).  Two examples of this would be
   1. Penguin vs Squid
   2. Orca vs vs Sea Lion
3. Mutualism, (Both species help each other).  Two examples of this would be
   1. Gobie and Pistol Shrimp. The gobie will flick its tail to warn the shrimp if predators are nearby.  The shrimp helps the gobie by building a burrow.

   3. Cleaner Wrasse and Sharks.  The wrasse helps the sharks by consuming plaque, parasites, and dead skin off of them.  The wrasse benefits by consuming the debris as food.

5. Parasitic (One creature uses a second host creature with no benefit to it, the parasite does not immmediately kill the host).  Two examples are
   1.  Fish lice (Tongue eating louse).  The louse will replace the fishes tongue with itself.  The louse will then eat mucus created by the fish

7. Competition
8. Commensalism


## Note From Jacob's father
I had to help Jacob quite a bit with this project, as I thought that this was the perfect opportunity to also expose him to different and new technologies namely

* He has never used github to store files
* We both have never used Google Earth to produce maps
* He only has a basic understanding of spreadsheets
* He has never used mermaid (markup) to produce graphics
