# Biome Science Project
This project is made up of several different files 

## Model/Map of a Marine Biome
This is a map made in Google Earth to showcase the location of several marine animals, and details regarding if they are producer/consumers or predator/prey
Directions to import this file can be found here:
1. Save this file: [Jacob's Biome Model.kml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mahldcat/jacobscienceproject/main/Jacob's%20Biome%20Model.kml) to disk
2. Next you will need to follow the directions here: https://support.google.com/earth/answer/7365595?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop 

Note:  A video of this map can be seen at https://youtu.be/oTztfc3mCYU

### Summary from the google earth map
The summary: Science Project
Mrs. Olsen

This attempts to map out where several animals can be found a Marine Biome. 

The animals in this map form a simple food web, and are examples of biotic features
* Plankton
* Krill
* Herring
* Killer Whale
* Penguins

Abiotic features of a marine biome include
* Sunlight (which is the start for every food chain) 
* Temperature (see the Weather Graphs spreadsheet for further details)
* Ocean Depth 
* Amount of Oxygen in the water
* Amount of Salt

About the Plankton:
I also learned there more than 2 types of plankon.  There are also
* Bacterioplankton: Consumer & Producer 
* Virioplankton: Consumer & Producer
I do not list these on the map, because these are probably not consumed by the other animals listed.

## Food Web
[FoodWeb](https://github.com/mahldcat/jacobscienceproject/blob/main/foodWeb.md)
This uses a markup language called Mermaid to showcase the food web for different marine animals 

## Weather Graphs
https://github.com/mahldcat/jacobscienceproject/blob/main/Jacob%20Biome%20Temp%20Charts.xlsx
This is an excel spreadsheet that contains the data and graphs for the different temperatures of the named oceans across the Earth

## Symbiotic Relationships in the Marine Biome 
1. Predation, (One creature eats the other).  Two examples of this would be
   1. Penguin vs Squid
   2. Orca vs vs Sea Lion
2. Mutualism, (Both species help each other).  Two examples of this would be
   1. Gobie and Pistol Shrimp. The gobie will flick its tail to warn the shrimp if predators are nearby.  The shrimp helps the gobie by building a burrow.
      1. (https://be.chewy.com/the-symbiotic-relationship-between-gobies-and-pistol-shrimp/)   
   3. Cleaner Wrasse and Sharks.  The wrasse helps the sharks by consuming plaque, parasites, and dead skin off of them.  The wrasse benefits by consuming the debris as food.
      1. https://sharkresearch.earth.miami.edu/exploitation-and-cooperation-by-cleaner-wrasse/ 
3. Parasitic (One creature uses a second host creature with no benefit to it, the parasite does not immmediately kill the host).  Two examples are
   1.  Fish lice (Tongue eating louse).  The louse will replace the fishes tongue with itself.  The louse will then eat mucus created by the fish

   2.  Sea Lamprey.  The lamprey attach to the body of a creature, and will either eat pieces of flesh, or blood.

4. Competition (can happen between the same species or different species)
   1. Coral vs Sponges (Different species), they compete for the same food.  
      1. https://reefs.com/sponges-demonstrated-as-competitive-threat-to-corals/  
   3. Sea Urchins (Same species), again compete for food resources 
      1. http://thepurpleseaurchinresource.weebly.com/ecology.html  
5. Commensalism (One species uses the second species, but without harm)
   1.  Clownfish using Anemones for protection.
       1. https://www.marinebio.org/conservation/marine-ecology/symbionts-parasites/ 
   2.  Barnacle on a Humpback whale.  The barnacle attaches to the whale without injuring it.  The barnacle then gets food as the whale feeds.

## Note From Jacob's father
I had to help Jacob quite a bit with this project, as I thought that this was the perfect opportunity to also expose him to different and new technologies namely

* He has never used github to store files
* We both have never used Google Earth to produce maps
* He only has a basic understanding of spreadsheets
* He has never used mermaid (markup) to produce graphics

## Further Followup for Thursday
* Add additional items mapping out abiotic factors in the google earth map
  * POI:  Each ocean
    * Temperature graph
    * https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/light_travel.html  light info for each creature
    * Average depth, max depth
    * Add a chart that shows the salinity for each ocean
    * Ocean Currents https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/tutorial_currents/04currents3.html
 * Rerecord the video
